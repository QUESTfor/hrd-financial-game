## 📈 Feature 1: Historical Trends

### **What It Does:**
Automatically tracks and visualizes how each player's assets and investments change over time as the game progresses.

### **How It Works:**
```
Month 1: Players submit → Data recorded
   ↓
Month 2: Admin advances → History saved
   ↓
Month 3: Admin advances → More history
   ↓
Statistics → Historical Trends → Beautiful line graphs! 📊
```

### **What You Can See:**

#### **A. Total Assets Over Time**
- Line graph showing each player's wealth growth
- Compare who's growing fastest
- Identify trends and patterns
- Growth rate analysis (% per month)

#### **B. Individual Investments**
- Stacked area chart for one player
- See how Savings/ETF/Stock/Startup change
- Understand strategy evolution
- Strategy consistency score

#### **C. All Players Comparison**
- Multi-line graph with all players
- See competitive dynamics
- Identify leaders over time
- Track position changes

### **Teaching Applications:**

**Lesson: Risk vs Reward**
```
1. Show Historical Trends after Month 3
2. Point out: "Team A took risks early, grew fast"
3. Point out: "Team B was conservative, steady growth"
4. Discuss: Which strategy is better? Depends on goals!
```

**Lesson: Compound Growth**
```
1. Show exponential curves on line graph
2. Explain how small % gains compound
3. Compare Team C (10%/month) vs Team D (5%/month)
4. Calculate: After 12 months, huge difference!
```

**Lesson: Strategy Changes**
```
1. Select one player's Individual Investments
2. Show how their allocation changed over time
3. Ask: "Why did they shift from savings to stocks?"
4. Discuss: Adapting strategy based on results
```

### **Access:**
```
Admin Dashboard → 📊 Statistics → Select "Historical Trends"
```

## 🎲 Feature 2: Monte Carlo Simulation

### **What It Is:**

**Simple Explanation:**
"Monte Carlo" is a fancy name for "run the same game 1,000 times with random luck and see what usually happens."

**Technical Explanation:**
A statistical technique that uses random sampling to model uncertainty and predict probability distributions of future outcomes.

### **How It Works:**

```
Step 1: Take current portfolio
   Example: $30K → 50% savings, 20% ETF, 20% stock, 10% startup

Step 2: Simulate one month ahead
   - Savings: Random return 0-0.5%
   - ETF: Random return -2% to +4%
   - Stock: Random return -10% to +15%
   - Startup: Random return -20% to +30% (5% chance of 0)
   - Add $10K income
   - Subtract expenses

Step 3: Repeat for 6 months (or however many you choose)

Step 4: Repeat entire process 1,000 times

Step 5: Analyze results
   - Average outcome: $X
   - Best case (95th percentile): $Y
   - Worst case (5th percentile): $Z
   - Probability of profit: A%
   - Probability of loss: B%
```

### **Why It's Useful:**

#### **For Students:**
```
❌ BAD: "I'll probably make money"
✅ GOOD: "I have 73% chance of gain, 27% chance of loss"

❌ BAD: "Stocks are risky"
✅ GOOD: "With my allocation, worst case I lose 15%, best case I gain 80%"
```

#### **For Teachers:**
```
- Teach probability and statistics
- Show uncertainty in investing
- Demonstrate risk quantification
- Compare safe vs risky strategies objectively
```

### **What Students Learn:**

**Concept 1: Uncertainty**
```
"You can't predict the future exactly, but you CAN:
 - Estimate ranges of outcomes
 - Calculate probabilities
 - Make informed decisions despite uncertainty"
```

**Concept 2: Risk Quantification**
```
"Risk isn't just 'high' or 'low', it's:
 - 15% chance of losing 20%+ of assets
 - 40% chance of doubling assets
 - Standard deviation of $12,000"
```

**Concept 3: Expected Value**
```
"Even if you might lose sometimes:
 Average outcome: $45,000
 Current assets: $30,000
 Expected gain: $15,000
 → Still worth the risk!"
```

### **How to Use in Class:**

#### **Activity 1: Compare Strategies**
```
1. Select conservative student (80% savings)
2. Run Monte Carlo: 1000 simulations, 6 months
3. Show: Low risk (5% chance of loss), low reward (10% growth)

4. Select aggressive student (80% stocks)
5. Run Monte Carlo: 1000 simulations, 6 months
6. Show: High risk (30% chance of loss), high reward (50% growth)

7. Discuss: Which is better? Depends on goals and risk tolerance!
```

#### **Activity 2: "What If" Scenarios**
```
Student: "Should I invest more in startups?"

Teacher: "Let's find out!"
1. Run simulation with current allocation
2. Show: 60% chance of profit, average outcome $40K
3. Ask: "What if you doubled your startup investment?"
4. (Manually adjust and re-run)
5. Show: 70% chance of profit, but also 20% chance of big loss
6. Student decides based on data!
```

#### **Activity 3: Teach Statistics**
```
Explain the histogram:
- "This is a distribution curve"
- "Most outcomes are near the middle (average)"
- "Few outcomes are extreme (best/worst case)"
- "This is called a normal distribution"
- "Standard deviation measures spread"

Real-world connection:
- Stock market works the same way!
- Can't predict exact return
- Can estimate probabilities
- This is how professionals analyze risk
```

### **Reading the Results:**

#### **Key Metrics Explained:**

```
Average Outcome: $45,000
→ If you ran game 1000 times, average result

Median Outcome: $43,000
→ Middle result (50% above, 50% below)

Best Case (95th %): $68,000
→ Only 5% of simulations did better

Worst Case (5th %): $28,000
→ Only 5% of simulations did worse

Std Deviation: $12,000
→ Typical spread from average

Chance of Gain: 73%
→ Probability of ending up with more than you started

Chance of Loss: 27%
→ Probability of ending up with less than you started
```

#### **Risk Assessment:**

```
Low Risk Strategy:
✅ 5% chance of losing 20%+
📈 15% chance of doubling
→ Safe but slow growth

Moderate Risk Strategy:
⚠️ 15% chance of losing 20%+
📈 25% chance of doubling
→ Balanced approach

High Risk Strategy:
❌ 35% chance of losing 20%+
🚀 50% chance of doubling
→ Aggressive growth or bust
```

### **Important: Firebase Secrets**

**⚠️ Security Warning:**
Your firebase-key.json contains sensitive credentials!

**Option A: Public Repo (Simple but Less Secure)**
```
- Upload firebase-key.json to GitHub
- Anyone can see your credentials
- OK for classroom (not critical data)
- Easy to set up
```

**Option B: Streamlit Secrets (More Secure)** ⭐ RECOMMENDED

1. **DON'T upload firebase-key.json to GitHub**

2. **In Streamlit Cloud Dashboard:**
   - Go to your app settings
   - Click "Secrets"
   - Paste your firebase JSON:
   ```toml
   [firebase]
   type = "service_account"
   project_id = "your-project-id"
   private_key_id = "your-key-id"
   private_key = "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
   client_email = "your-service-account@....iam.gserviceaccount.com"
   client_id = "..."
   auth_uri = "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth"
   token_uri = "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token"
   auth_provider_x509_cert_url = "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs"
   client_x509_cert_url = "..."
   ```

3. **Update app.py:**
   ```python
   # Old way:
   cred = credentials.Certificate('firebase-key.json')
   
   # New way:
   import json
   firebase_secrets = json.loads(st.secrets["firebase"])
   cred = credentials.Certificate(firebase_secrets)
   ```

---

### **Troubleshooting:**

#### **Error: Module not found**
```
Solution: Check requirements.txt has all packages
→ streamlit, plotly, firebase-admin, numpy, scipy
```

#### **Error: Firebase authentication failed**
```
Solution: Check firebase-key.json is uploaded
Or: Use Streamlit Secrets (more secure)
```

#### **Error: App won't start**
```
Solution: Check Streamlit Cloud logs
→ Dashboard → Your App → Logs
→ Look for error messages
```

#### **App is slow**
```
Solution: Streamlit Cloud free tier has limits
→ Consider caching more data
→ Or upgrade to paid tier ($20/month for better performance)
```

---

### **Free Tier Limits:**

```
✅ 1 private app OR 3 public apps
